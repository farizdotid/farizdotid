### Hi there 👋 I am Fariz

More than nine years ago, I wrote my first line of Android code. Back then, Java reigned supreme, and Kotlin was just a whisper in the wind. I remember the thrill of seeing my first app come alive on a screen, a tap here, a swipe there, and thinking: “I built this.”

Those early days were filled with late nights, messy logs, and tiny victories. I loved it. I thrived on the challenge of crafting seamless mobile experiences, debugging, optimizing, and shipping features that real users relied on. I was proud to call myself an Android Developer.

But over time, curiosity crept in.

I started wondering:
“What happens after the button is pressed?”
“Where does the data go?”
“How does it all really work?”

So, I peeked behind the curtain, and stepped into the world of backend development. At first, it felt like I was in foreign territory. Servers, APIs, databases, it was overwhelming. But also... exciting. Every layer I uncovered made the whole picture clearer. I wasn’t just coding, I was connecting dots.

As I explored deeper, I began building beyond the screen, designing backend logic, setting up databases, writing APIs. Eventually, I was handling both the frontend and backend, and that's when I realized: I had become a Full Stack Developer.

I was no longer just focused on what users see. I was thinking about how everything works together. From smooth mobile interfaces to powerful backend systems, I loved every piece of it.

The journey?
It hasn’t ended. It never does.
There’s always a new tool, a new language, a new challenge.
And honestly? That’s what makes it worth it. ❤️
