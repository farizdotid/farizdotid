### Hi there 👋 I am Fariz

I started my journey as an Android Developer more than nine years ago—back when Java was the king, and Kotlin was just a rumor. I spent years crafting mobile apps, debugging complex issues, and optimizing performance to create smooth, reliable experiences. I love the challenge of turning ideas into fully functional applications that people actually use.

But somewhere along the way, I got curious. I wanted to understand the bigger picture—not just the frontend experience, but what happens behind the scenes. That’s when I started diving into backend development. At first, it was just an experiment, a way to expand my skill set. But soon, I found myself enjoying the logic, the database structures, and the way everything connects.

And then, I discovered Ruby on Rails. Something about its simplicity, elegance, and convention-over-configuration approach just clicked with me. Suddenly, I wasn’t just a mobile developer anymore—I was building fullstack applications, handling both the frontend and backend, and loving every second of it.

Now, I see myself as more than just an Android Developer. I’m someone who enjoys crafting solutions, whether it's in mobile, backend, or fullstack development. I love the process of building things that work—from user-friendly mobile apps to powerful, scalable backends.

And honestly? The journey never stops. There’s always something new to learn, a new challenge to tackle, and a new way to grow. ❤️
